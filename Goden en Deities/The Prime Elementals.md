## Overview

The Prime Elementals are not true gods but powerful entities that formed naturally from the convergence of leylines beneath Elarion. They might be fragments of elemental gods who died in the Divine War, or they might be something entirely newâ€”pure elemental force given consciousness by concentrated magical energy.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Grant powers similar to gods but are more primal, less philosophical
- Can physically manifest in Elarion (true gods cannot easily do this)
- Maintain the elemental balance that keeps the city stable
- Their priests are more like druids or elemental sorcerers than traditional clerics

## The Balance of Elarion

### The Elemental Council
The city is governed by representatives from each elemental district:
- **Flame Speaker** (represents Ignareth)
- **Flow Keeper** (represents Thalrion)
- **Wind Voice** (represents Zephyros)
- **Stone Warden** (represents Goramm)

They meet daily to ensure the elemental balance remains stable. Disputes are resolved through rituals that involve all four elements.

### Signs of Imbalance
When the balance shifts, the city suffers:
- **Too much Fire**: Spontaneous combustion, heat waves, aggressive behavior
- **Too much Water**: Floods, excessive rain, melancholy and depression
- **Too much Air**: Destructive storms, objects flying away, scattered thoughts
- **Too much Earth**: Earthquakes, buildings sinking, lethargy and stagnation

### Maintaining Balance
Daily rituals performed by the priesthoods:
- **Dawn**: Ignareth's fires are lit
- **Midday**: Thalrion's waters flow through the city
- **Dusk**: Zephyros's winds are called to cleanse the air
- **Midnight**: Goramm's stones are blessed for stability

### The Convergence Point
At the center of Elarion, all four elements meet:
- A chamber where fire, water, air, and earth exist in perfect harmony
- Elementals can be seen physically interacting here
- The most powerful rituals are performed here
- It's said the Prime Elementals were born here
