# Helion & Selene, The Twins

## Core Identity
- **Primary Domains**: Order, Knowledge, Arcana, Peace
- **Universal Symbol**: Two interlocked rings, one silver (Selene), one gold (Helion)
- **Cosmic Role**: Mediate disputes between gods and mortals, promoting balance through diplomacy rather than force
- **Why They Survived**: They likely negotiated the peace between gods during the Divine War, establishing the new cosmic order

### Their Unity
While they can be worshipped separately, their true power comes from their partnership. They represent that opposing approaches can work toward the same goal.

## Theological Concepts

### The Doctrine of Twin Truths
Both twins teach that truth has many faces:
- **Helion's Truth**: Direct, empirical, observable
- **Selene's Truth**: Subtle, intuitive, felt
- Both are valid; both are necessary

### The Balance of Knowledge
- **Open Knowledge** (Helion): Should be shared, taught, written down
- **Hidden Knowledge** (Selene): Should be earned, learned gradually, passed carefully
- Deciding which knowledge is which requires wisdom

### The Paradox of Order
- Order isn't rigid control (that leads to tyranny)
- Order isn't the absence of chaos (that leads to stagnation)
- True order is dynamic equilibrium—the twins' eternal dance

## The Twins and The Divine War

The Twins' role in ending the Divine War is central to their worship:

**The Great Negotiation**:
- For years, they mediated between warring gods
- Their persistence prevented total annihilation
- When words failed, they helped Valthor understand when force was necessary
- After the culling, they established the new divine covenant

**The Sacred Compromise**:
- Each surviving god surrendered some power for cosmic stability
- The Twins ensured no god would dominate
- They maintain this balance still, though mortals rarely see it

## Invoking the Twins

Unlike Valthor (dangerous) or Veylan/Noctare (selective), the Twins are considered safe to invoke:

- They answer those who genuinely seek resolution
- Prayers for clarity in disputes are often answered
- Students in crisis may receive intuitive guidance
- They never demand violence or sacrifice
- Their blessing is subtle—a sudden insight, a chance meeting, a perfect word

The worst that happens when they don't answer? You must figure it out yourself—which might be the lesson they're teaching.
