# Noctare, The Custodian

## Core Identity
- **Primary Domains**: Death, Grave, Trickery, Twilight
- **Universal Symbol**: A skeletal hand cradling a dying ember
- **Cosmic Role**: Ensures death occurs naturally, guiding souls and preventing unnatural life extension
- **Why She Survived**: Death is inevitable and impartial. She remained neutral during the Divine War, claiming casualties from all sides equally

**Worship Practices**:
- Soldiers perform quiet rituals before battle, acknowledging they may not return

- Veterans' groups honor her as the one who receives their fallen comrades

**Symbols in Oryndal**:
- The skeletal hand often holds a military medal or broken sword
- Grave markers incorporate her symbol subtly
- Memorial monuments in Dreunheim feature her imagery prominently

**Philosophy**:
- Death in service is honorable
- Accepting mortality makes life meaningful
- Those who've seen death understand her necessity
- "The Final Duty" is what all soldiers must eventually fulfill

**Primary Followers**:
- Soldiers and military officers
- Morticians and grave keepers
- Veterans who've lost comrades
- Executioners and lawkeepers (those who must sometimes decree death)

**Cultural Notes**:
- Public worship is uncommon but private devotion is widespread in military circles
- Seen as grim necessity rather than evil
- Dreunheim has the most open Noctare worship in Oryndal

### Aeloris - "The Gentle Transition"
**Interpretation**: Death as natural passage, openly celebrated

**Worship Practices**:
- Festivals honoring the dead are joyous occasions

- Fighting death unnaturally disrupts the cosmic balance

**Primary Followers**:
- Death clerics and grave domain priests
- Philosophers and scholars of the cycle
- Those who've lost loved ones and seek comfort
- Monks seeking enlightenment through understanding mortality

**Cultural Notes**:
- Much more openly worshipped than in Oryndal
- Temples are peaceful, contemplative places
- Not seen as dark or evil, but as necessary and even comforting

## Theological Controversies

**The Undeath Question**:
- Is undeath always wrong, or are there acceptable forms?
- Most agree vampirism and lichdom pervert her will
- Debate continues over resurrection magic and animate dead spells
- Some argue brief undeath (revivify) is acceptable; prolonged undeath is not

**The Euthanasia Debate**:
- Should suffering be ended early if death is inevitable?
- Aeloris clerics often say yes; Oryndal clerics are divided
- Her silence on the matter is interpreted differently by different factions

**The Wartime Paradox**:
- Does she favor soldiers who kill, or condemn them?
- Most agree she's neutral—death in battle is natural to warfare
- But mass slaughter and genocide are seen as perversions of her domain

## Noctare and The Divine War

During the Divine War, Noctare remained neutral, claiming the fallen from all sides without judgment. Some theologians believe this neutrality is why she survived—she was needed by everyone, opposed by none. Her clergy teach that death came even to gods, proving no one is exempt from her domain.
