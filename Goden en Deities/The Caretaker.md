## Veylan's Silence
Like all the surviving gods, Veylan rarely intervenes directly. His clerics interpret his will through:
- Signs in nature (Aeloris interpretation)
- Successful innovations and safe industries (Oryndal interpretation)
- Dreams and visions (all regions)
- The success or failure of healing and growth
