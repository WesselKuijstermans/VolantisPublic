# Aethros - The Ascended Archmage

## Core Identity
- **Domains**: Arcana (pure), Magic itself
- **Symbol**: A mortal hand grasping a star, fingers wrapped around cosmic energy
- **Alternative Symbol**: A spell formula that has become a constellation
- **Status**: Mortal wizard who achieved godhood during or shortly after the Divine War
- **Nature**: Not one of the original gods, but something new—a mortal who transcended

## Theories About Origin

### The Consuming Ascension
During the Divine War, the God of Magic was mortally wounded. Aethros, already the most powerful mortal wizard of the age, performed a ritual to absorb the dying god's essence. He succeeded, but the transformation was incomplete—he became divine but retained his mortal memories and limitations.

**Evidence Supporting This**:
- Aethros's magic feels "different" from divine magic
- He seems bound by rules other gods aren't
- Some claim to hear two voices when he manifests

### The Stolen Throne
Aethros was a warlock who betrayed his patron god during the Divine War. He used forbidden knowledge to kill and replace his patron, seizing divine power through treachery. He is the only fallen god who survived—by becoming something else entirely.

**Evidence Supporting This**:
- His worship is uncommon in Oryndal (where warlocks are despised)
- Some of his rituals bear warlock characteristics
- He grants power differently than other gods
- **This theory is largely considered heretical**

## Worship Across Volantis

### In Aeloris - The Revered Ascended

**Primary Centers of Worship**:
- **Vel'Aeryn**: Major temples, seen as proof that mastery of magic can lead to transcendence
- **Concordia**: Acknowledged in the pantheon, though debated by different magical schools
- **Mirrathis**: Some illusionists worship him as the ultimate "changed self"

**Philosophy**:
- Mortals can touch divinity through arcane mastery
- Magic is not just a tool but a path to enlightenment
- The arcane is a domain mortals have rightful claim to
- His existence proves magic belongs to mortals, not just gods

**Worship Practices**:
- Spell research is performed as prayer
- Breakthroughs in magical theory are dedicated to him
- Grand rituals on his "ascension day" (date debated)
- Wizards completing their training make pilgrimages to his temples

**Followers**:
- Wizards (especially arcanists and transmuters)
- Magical researchers and theorists
- Ambitious mages seeking their own transcendence
- Sorcerers curious about the nature of innate magic

### In Oryndal - The Dangerous Myth

**Common Beliefs**:
- Either doesn't exist (propaganda/Aeloris myth)
- Exists but is an abomination (mortal who stole divine power)
- Exists as a cautionary tale (this is what happens when magic goes too far)

**Why He's Feared**:
- Represents everything Oryndal distrusts about magic
- If a mortal can become a god, what does that mean for social order?
- Warlocks are despised; an "ascended warlock" is nightmare fuel

**Small Cult Following**:
- Secret societies in Ardenval study him
- Rogue wizards seeking forbidden knowledge
- Those who believe technology and magic must merge
- Revolutionaries who see his ascension as proof that anyone can transcend their station

**Government Position**:
- Official stance: doesn't exist, Aeloris propaganda
- Unofficial: probably exists, must suppress worship
- Publishing texts about him is technically illegal but rarely enforced

## How Aethros Grants Power

### Not Traditional Divine Magic
Aethros doesn't grant power like other gods. Instead:

**For Clerics** (extremely rare):
- Must be wizards who multiclass into cleric
- Domains: Arcana only
- Spells feel different—more like wizard magic than divine magic
- No holy symbols; use their own arcane focus
- Class features work differently (DM discretion)

**For Warlocks** (more common):
- Patron type: Undying or Celestial (warped)
- The pact feels unstable, like he's barely holding himself together
- Boons are often magical knowledge rather than raw power
- Messages from him are cryptic, fragmented

**For Wizards** (most common):
- Not worshippers but "students"
- Pray to him for insight during research
- May receive sudden breakthroughs (inspiration)
- Dreams containing spell formulas
- Visions during meditation near leylines

**Unique Mechanic - The Ascended's Blessing**:
Any arcane spellcaster who genuinely venerates him can attempt to petition for knowledge:
- Once per long rest, spend 1 hour in meditation
- Make an Arcana check (DC 20)
- On success, gain insight into a specific magical problem
- He doesn't always answer; when he does, it's fragmentary

## Manifestations and Encounters

### How Aethros Appears
When he manifests (rarely), Aethros appears as:
- A figure made of living spell formulae and starlight
- Constantly shifting, unstable, flickering between forms
- Sometimes recognizably humanoid, sometimes pure energy
- Eyes that are windows into the void between stars
- Voice that sounds like many voices speaking the same words at slightly different times

### His Lucid Moments
On rare occasions, Aethros manifests fully coherent:
- Speaks with regret about his transformation
- Warns against seeking his path
- Seems lonely, trapped in divinity
- Offers genuine wisdom to those who seek understanding over power
- Then fragments again, losing coherence

### His Fragmented State
More commonly, he appears as:
- Visions that don't make sense
- Spell effects with no obvious caster
- Dreams that teach magic but terrify the dreamer
- Echoes of conversations he had when mortal
- Raw magical energy without consciousness directing it
