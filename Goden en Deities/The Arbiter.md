# Valthor, The Arbiter

## Valthor and The Divine War

Most theologians believe Valthor ended the Divine War. When the conflict threatened to destroy reality itself, he stepped in with ultimate force, destroying gods who refused to compromise. His survival is seen as proof that balance, even enforced brutally, is necessary for existence.

Some whisper he didn't just end the war—he orchestrated it. That the imbalance of too many gods was itself what he culled. These theories are considered heretical but persist.

## Invoking Valthor

Unlike Veylan and Noctare, calling upon Valthor is dangerous. His answer might be exactly what you need—or it might be fire and judgment. His clergy teach:

- Only invoke him when truly necessary
- Be prepared for harsh answers to hard questions
- If you call for balance, be ready to be part of the cost
- His silence is often a blessing
